# Intelly - General Overview and Current State

The Fieldist repos are part of a larger project called Intelly, which is a platform being built to help small-to-medium-sized food and beverage brands manage various aspects of their business. The project is divided into separate repos to allow indeoendent development. Below, you can find a list of the specific fton and back ends that make up this project, links to their individual repos, as well as whether or not they have been deployed for public demo.

The public demos should be accessed thought this link: https://gallant-wing-415919.netlify.app/

# This Specific Repo - Overview

As mentioned above, Intelly is split into several independent repos in order to facilitate different timelines for development, and thus make it possible to demonstrate those services that have reached an appropriate stage of devlopment.

The repo you are currently visiting is a React Native version of the front end for the Field Events application. It is not a current priority but will ultimately be devloped to be a Native version of the fieldist-rep-web-client project.

# Installation and Contribution

If you wish to test this project locally, you may clone the repo to a directory on your machine. Navigate to the new directory using your terminal, and run it as a React Native project with Expo.

At this time, I am not inviting individual contribution, unless there has been a specific conversation around it. If you come across something in the code that you wish to share, by all means message me and we can speak about it.
